# MobChat 
MobChat is a group chat app for users to experience and chat about live events together. Users can set calendar reminders for air dates 
to receive notifications about the event. 

The app incorporates all the common features youâ€™d expect from a group chat application, but a concept 
I wanted to test was allowing for more democratic control. This meant instead of a single owner controlling features of the chat room, 
all users played a part in maintaining the room such as uploading highlights and adding calendar reminders. This worked by providing a chat log which allowed 
users to monitor others, and kick those who weren't behaving.
